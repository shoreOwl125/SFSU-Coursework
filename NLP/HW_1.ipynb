The concept behind ELIZA's responses is to reflect the user's input back \n# to them in a way that elicits further discussion about their thoughts or feelings. The program uses the \n# Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) which contains ELIZA's method definitions and \"reflections\" which contains a \n# dictionary toÂ reflect pronouns from the user's inputÂ Â (e.g. my, i, me) back to the user in a response \n# (e.g. your, you).Â ELIZA functions by using regular expressions to match patterns in the user input and generate \n# a relevant response. The chatbot is therefore structured around two core components. The first component being the \n# pairs of regular expression patterns with corresponding responses. The second component being the reflections dictionary \n# that translates first-person pronouns to second-person or the other way around to address the user more realistically.\n\n# ELIZA initially uses regular expressions (in theÂ def _compile_reflections(self)) method along with the reflections dictionary \n# to effectively substitute pronouns within the conversation. This step makes the conversation more realistic for the user \n# because it adjusts the perspective between the user and the ELIZA. The wildcard expressionsÂ  and corresponding group-macros \n# referenced in the responses allows ELIZA to capture portions of the user's input and then substitute it into the response \n# generated for a moreÂ relevant and realistic conversation.Â \n\n# Response generation is a systematic process where the program looks through the sequence of predefined tuples \n# (pattern-response pairs), selecting the first tuple that matches the user input with a pattern. This is typically several \n# words and/or regular expressions. One of the responses from the associated matched pattern is selected at random and it is \n# either output directly to the user or customized to make it more relevant using the reflection and substitution procedures \n# described. ELIZA's ability to keep a continuous conversation going hinges on it continuously provoking the user for another \n# input, processing it, and repeating until the user types \"quit\".\n\n# This program demonstrates some of the foundational principles of NLP including pattern matching, regular expressions, and text \n# substitution. The result is to simulate an engaging conversation with a therapist. There were some challenging aspects \n# regarding the precedence of the user input pattern matching. The order in which the predefined tuples are listed matters \n# and sometimes the pattern you hope to match is overlooked by a simpler pattern even if it is lower on the list. It can be \n# challenging to have catch all patterns for any input but still prioritize specific topic related patterns that require more \n# complex patterns.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-09T06:15:02.952205Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-09T06:15:02.952713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-09T06:26:09.003608Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-09T06:15:02.952673Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-09T06:26:09.002259Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Therapist\n---------\nTalk to the program by typing in plain English, using normal upper-\nand lower-case letters and punctuation.
